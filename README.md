# trafficSimulator
Traffic simulation viewed through GUI

Different car colors are driven by different drivers 
* Red cars have aggressive drivers with a high preffered speed
* Green drivers are distance drivers who try to maintin a good space between them and the car in front
* Blue drivers are passive drivers who never merge
* Grey drivers are normal drivers
* Cars turn pink while their drivers want to merge

The simulation runs through several different scenarios. We compare how much traffic using a different number of each driver creates by measuring the average speed and a few other statistics. We also compare this simulation to adding a fourth lane to the freeway. Final results can be found in the statsList file.
